/**
 * Follow up for "Unique Paths":
 *
 * <p>Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
 *
 * <p>An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
 *
 * <p>For example, There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.
 *
 * <p>[ [0,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,0] ]
 *
 * <p>The total number of unique paths is 2.
 *
 * <p>Note: m and n will be at most 100.
