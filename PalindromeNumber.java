/**
 * Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.
 *
 * <p>Some hints: Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)
 *
 * <p>If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra
 * space.
 *
 * <p>You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse
 * Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?
 *
 * <p>There is a more generic way of solving this problem.
