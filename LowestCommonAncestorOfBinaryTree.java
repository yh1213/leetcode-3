/**
 * Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor of two given nodes in the tree.
 *
 * <p>_______3______ / \ ___5__ ___1__ / \ / \ 6 _2 0 8 / \ 7 4 If you are not so sure about the
 * definition of lowest common ancestor (LCA), please refer to my previous post: Lowest Common
 * Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree (BST) or the definition of LCA here. Using the tree above as an
 * example, the LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. Please note that LCA for nodes 5 and 4 is 5.
 *
 * <p>Hint: Top-down or bottom-up? Consider both approaches and see which one is more efficient.
