/**
 * Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.
 *
 * <p>OJ's undirected graph serialization: Nodes are labeled uniquely.
 *
 * <p>We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor
 * of the node. As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.
 *
 * <p>The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.
 *
 * <p>First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2. Second node is labeled as 1.
 * Connect node 1 to node 2. Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus
 * forming a self-cycle. Visually, the graph looks like the following:
 *
 * <p>1 / \ / \ 0 --- 2 / \ \_/
